# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Multi-Agent Trading System is a sophisticated financial trading platform that leverages multiple specialized AI agents working collaboratively to make informed trading decisions. The system employs four distinct agent types - Market Analyst, Risk Manager, Portfolio Optimizer, and Execution Agent - each with specialized capabilities that contribute to a comprehensive trading strategy. The agents communicate through message passing protocols and utilize consensus mechanisms to ensure robust decision-making while incorporating continuous learning through reinforcement learning techniques.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a trading firm, I want a multi-agent system that can analyze market conditions and make trading decisions autonomously, so that I can execute trades 24/7 with consistent strategy application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is initialized THEN all four agent types (Market Analyst, Risk Manager, Portfolio Optimizer, Execution Agent) SHALL be instantiated and ready for operation
2. WHEN market data is received THEN the Market Analyst agent SHALL process technical and sentiment analysis within 100ms
3. WHEN trading signals are generated THEN the system SHALL require consensus from at least 3 out of 4 agents before executing trades
4. WHEN the system operates THEN it SHALL maintain 99.9% uptime during market hours

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a risk manager, I want agents to communicate through reliable message passing, so that all trading decisions are coordinated and transparent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agent generates a signal or analysis THEN it SHALL publish the message to the appropriate Redis/RabbitMQ channel within 10ms
2. WHEN agents receive messages THEN they SHALL acknowledge receipt and process the information within their specialized domain
3. WHEN message delivery fails THEN the system SHALL retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff
4. IF an agent becomes unresponsive THEN the system SHALL detect the failure within 30 seconds and initiate failover procedures

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a portfolio manager, I want the system to implement consensus-based decision making, so that trading decisions are validated by multiple perspectives before execution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a trading opportunity is identified THEN each agent SHALL provide a weighted vote (0-100) on the proposed action
2. WHEN votes are collected THEN the system SHALL execute trades only if the weighted consensus score exceeds 75
3. WHEN agents disagree significantly (variance > 40) THEN the system SHALL require manual review before proceeding
4. WHEN consensus is reached THEN the decision rationale SHALL be logged with individual agent contributions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a quantitative analyst, I want each agent to specialize in distinct analysis domains, so that the system covers all critical aspects of trading decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN market data is available THEN the Market Analyst SHALL perform technical analysis using at least 10 different indicators
2. WHEN news and social media data is received THEN the Market Analyst SHALL conduct sentiment analysis with confidence scores
3. WHEN trading signals are proposed THEN the Risk Manager SHALL evaluate position sizing, stop-loss levels, and portfolio exposure
4. WHEN risk assessment is complete THEN the Portfolio Optimizer SHALL determine optimal allocation across assets and strategies
5. WHEN execution parameters are set THEN the Execution Agent SHALL handle order routing, slippage minimization, and trade timing

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive MLOps capabilities, so that I can monitor, version, and improve agent performance over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agent models are updated THEN the system SHALL maintain version control with rollback capabilities
2. WHEN new strategies are deployed THEN the system SHALL support A/B testing with configurable traffic splitting
3. WHEN agents are operating THEN the system SHALL collect real-time performance metrics including accuracy, latency, and profitability
4. WHEN market regimes change THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger model retraining based on performance degradation thresholds

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a machine learning engineer, I want agents to learn from shared experiences, so that the entire system improves collectively over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN trades are executed THEN all agents SHALL contribute their decision factors to a shared experience replay buffer
2. WHEN sufficient experience is accumulated THEN the system SHALL initiate reinforcement learning training sessions
3. WHEN training is complete THEN updated models SHALL be deployed using blue-green deployment strategies
4. WHEN agents learn THEN they SHALL maintain individual specialization while benefiting from collective insights

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want complete audit trails and risk controls, so that all trading activities can be monitored and regulated appropriately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any agent makes a decision THEN the system SHALL log the decision with timestamp, rationale, and confidence level
2. WHEN trades are executed THEN the system SHALL record all agent votes, consensus scores, and execution details
3. WHEN risk limits are approached THEN the system SHALL automatically reduce position sizes or halt trading
4. WHEN regulatory reporting is required THEN the system SHALL generate comprehensive reports on agent behavior and trading performance

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want real-time monitoring and alerting capabilities, so that I can ensure system health and performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system metrics exceed normal ranges THEN alerts SHALL be sent to operators within 5 seconds
2. WHEN agent performance degrades THEN the system SHALL automatically switch to backup models or manual mode
3. WHEN market volatility spikes THEN the system SHALL adjust risk parameters and notify operators
4. WHEN system resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL prioritize critical agent functions and scale horizontally if needed
